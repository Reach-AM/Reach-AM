# Hi, Iâ€™m [Ricardo Alonso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-alonso/) (Richard)

I am a computer engineering student, interested in ux/ui, web and application development and even some game development. These fields of study are of interest to me because I have always had a special interest in developing friendly and useful services for users that can help improve their quality of life.
